### Jack Huynh

Hey, I am Jack, a fanatical open sourceror. Working at Beowulf. ðŸ‘‹

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find my [full projects list here](https://moored-word-5c0.notion.site/To-Customer-Product-ToC-Product-6efe08d4f7e74393afeba968822a85ee). I'm also a big fan of Vuejs, Nuxtjs, Electronjs, Nodejs, Rust and webRTC Livesteaming is my focus now.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on [Reels](https://www.facebook.com/reel/679908756942208). If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Vietnam), maybe we can hang out and take some photos or code together.
