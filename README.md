### Jack Huynh

Hey, I'm Jackâ€”an open-source enthusiast currently crafting code from ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ðŸ‘‹ My passion? Bringing ideas to life. Check out my project lineup here [full projects list here](https://moored-word-5c0.notion.site/To-Customer-Product-ToC-Product-6efe08d4f7e74393afeba968822a85ee)

I'm all about Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Electron.js, Node.js, Rust, and diving into webRTC Livesteaming. ðŸš€

When not coding, I'm capturing moments through photography and exploring. Peep my adventures on Reels [link here](https://www.facebook.com/reel/679908756942208). If you're around Vietnam, let's grab a coffee and snap some pics or code together.
